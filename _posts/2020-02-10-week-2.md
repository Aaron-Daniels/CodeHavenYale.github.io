- Live Coding (5 min): demonstrate how to use conditionals in Scratch
- Worksheet (25 min): log into Scratch accounts and work on the worksheet
- Wrap up (5 min): see how conditionals fit with the maze activity

## Worksheet
### Part 1: Cats on the Run!

Let’s make the Scratch Cat run away from the mouse pointer!

- First, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

- Then, create a conditional that runs if the pointer gets too close to Scratch.

- Finally, complete the conditional to make Scratch run away from the pointer!



Here's a block bank to get you started!

### Part 2: A Wild Cat Chase!



Let’s make the Scratch Cat run towards the mouse whenever it’s held down! Whenever the user lets go of the mouse, Scratch should spin around!

    - Again, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

    - Next, create a conditional that runs if the mouse is held down.

    - Finally, complete the conditional to make Scratch run to the pointer or spin around!!



Here are the blocks you should use!

### Part 3: Upside-Downsizing!



Let’s make Scratch grow or shrink when we press the arrow keys!

    - One more time, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

    - Now, create two conditionals: one that runs if the up arrow, and one that runs if the down arrow is pressed.

    - Finally, complete the conditionals to make Scratch grow or shrink!



Here's one more block bank, but beware! You might need to use some of these twice!

### Questions to Discuss



How do conditionals fit into our maze game?



What else can you imagine doing in Scratch with conditionals?



Where do you see conditionals in your daily life?
