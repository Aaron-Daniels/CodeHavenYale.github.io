## Challenge Worksheet
### Make a start page!

We want to welcome people to our maze, so let’s make a start screen! 

    - First, choose a new backdrop for your maze by pressing the button in the bottom right corner.

    - Then, play around with these blocks to make a start page!

### Make a “you win” page!

Let’s reward our players for beating the maze with a “you win” screen. It’s very similar to making a start page, so use the blocks above!

### Add a points system!

When players get to the end or touch an object, they should get a point!

     - First, make your own variable by pressing the make a variable button under the variables tab.

    - Then, think about when you want your cat to earn points! For example, you could earn points when you win, when you touch a certain object, or when you press a certain keyboard key. 
    
    - Set up a conditional that will check if this has happened, and then increases the points variable!

Here are some blocks to start with:

### Add more levels!

This is a tricky one! Here are some questions to think about: 

    - When should my cat play a new level? 
    - Should the rules be different in the new level? 
    - How is the code similar in the new level? 

    - Consider making a new background and using these blocks to get started:

### Add sounds! 

Cats love to meow! Let’s make our Scratch cat speak out loud as he plays the game. Here are some blocks to start with:

### Make your cat teleport!

Add some teleportation portals to your maze! When the cat reaches a teleportation portal, it should change locations. 

    - How should you change the maze background so that teleportation makes sense? 
    
    - Make sure you figure out the coordinates correctly!
