    - Make the program run forever when the flag is pressed.

    - Make four conditionals, one for each arrow button that can be pressed 

    - Add the correct direction inside each arrow conditional

### Part 3: From the Window…

When Scratch runs into a wall, he should teleport back to the start!

    - The blocks below should go in Scratch’s forever loop!

     - We should have a conditional that runs when Scratch hits the wall color, sending him to the start and making him say a sad message.
