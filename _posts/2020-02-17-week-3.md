### Lesson Plan Overview:
View our detailed lesson plan [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vYh85Un-C9A8tvYibRUlcqSHaGt3sM7NA21uvZ6NVJc).
- Introduction (5 min): Review conditionals
- Unplugged Activity (10 min): Dance Party activity!
- Live Coding (10 min): Demonstrate types of loops in Scratch
- Worksheet (30 min): Log into Scratch accounts and work on the worksheet
- Wrap up (5 min): See how loops fit with the maze activity

### Part 1: Painting in Scratch!

Let’s make the Scratch Cat paint a line on the screen!

    - Click the + button in the bottom left corner and add the pen extension to your Scratch environment

    - First, make the cat put the pen down when the flag is clicked 

    - Then, make the cat take 20 steps forward and wait 1 second. This should repeat 10 times.

Here's the Block Bank:

Question: What does your cat draw when you click the flag? 

### Part 2: Painting With Many Colors!

Let’s make the Scratch Cat draw a multicolored shape on the screen!

![image #2](/assets/images/week2/img2.png)

    - Again, make Scratch put the pen down when we press the flag.
    
    - Then, make the Scratch Cat move 50 steps, turn 45 degrees, and change pen colors - 8 times in a row.
    
Here's the Block Bank:

Question: What’s the difference between what your cat draws in part 1 and part 2? What new blocks are used in part 2? 

### Part 3: Randomness!

Let’s make the Scratch Cat draw a picture that includes random elements! 

![image #3](/assets/images/week2/img3.png)

    - Again, make Scratch put the pen down when we press the flag.
    - Now, create a loop that will repeat 100 times.
    - Inside the loop, move a random number of steps, turn a random number of degrees, and change pen color by a random number.
    - Finally, add a block to make sure that Scratch will bounce when he hits the edge of the screen!
    

Here are some blocks to get you started:

### Challenges:

Can you change your drawing so that it uses two loops?

How else can we use randomness to make your drawing even more unique?
