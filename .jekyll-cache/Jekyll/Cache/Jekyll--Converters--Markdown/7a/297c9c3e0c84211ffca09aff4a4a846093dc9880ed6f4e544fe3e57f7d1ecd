<p>Code Haven was founded in 2016 with the mission of increasing access to Computer Science Education in the greater area. Since our founding, weâ€™ve expanded from our beginnings in a single classroom to reaching more than 150 students across the Elm City. Weâ€™ve helped many years of middle school students learn about CS fundamentals, and go from knowing no code to creating their apps over the course of a year.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-curriculum">Open Source Curriculum</h2>

<p>Weâ€™ve created this site in order to help further our mission of CS accessibility. We hope that having access to the curriculum weâ€™ve developed over the past four years will serve as a useful resource in the mission of making CS education accessible.</p>
