<h3 id="part-1-moving-in-scratch">Part 1: Moving in Scratch!</h3>

<p>Let’s make the Scratch cat move up, down, left, and right with arrows!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Make the program run forever when the flag is pressed

- Make four conditionals, one for each arrow button that can be pressed 

- Add the correct direction inside each arrow conditional 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s the Block Bank:</p>

<p>Question: How are we using coordinates to make the Scratch cat move?</p>

<h3 id="part-2-splatter-painting">Part 2: Splatter Painting!</h3>

<p>Let’s keep working on the last part! When we press the spacebar, Scratch should go somewhere random. Also, Scratch should use the pen to make cool drawings as he moves!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Click the + button to give Scratch a pen.

- Inside our loop from the last activity, add one more conditional to check if the spacebar is pressed!

- When it is, Scratch should move randomly.

- Outside our loop, make Scratch put the pen down!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="part-3-apple-chasing">Part 3: Apple Chasing!</h3>

<p>Don’t get rid of your last project yet - it’s time to make a game! Whenever Scratch runs into the apple, he should get a point, and the apple should run away from him!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/week5/img3.png" alt="image #3" /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Add a new sprite with the + Sprite button!

- We need a new variable 'score.' When we click the flag, the score should be set to 0. 

- Then, we should have a loop that runs forever, checking each time if Scratch is touching the apple.

- When he is, he should get a point and the apple should move!
</code></pre></div></div>
