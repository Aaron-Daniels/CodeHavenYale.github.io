<p>Letâ€™s make the Scratch Cat run away from the mouse pointer!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/week2/img1.png" alt="image #1" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then, create a conditional that runs if the pointer gets too close to Scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, complete the conditional to make Scratch run away from the pointer!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hereâ€™s a block bank to get you started!</p>

<h3 id="part-2-a-wild-cat-chase">Part 2: A Wild Cat Chase!</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s make the Scratch Cat run towards the mouse whenever itâ€™s held down! Whenever the user lets go of the mouse, Scratch should spin around!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/week2/img2.png" alt="image #2" /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- Again, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

- Next, create a conditional that runs if the mouse is held down.

- Finally, complete the conditional to make Scratch run to the pointer or spin around!!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are the blocks you should use!</p>

<h3 id="part-3-upside-downsizing">Part 3: Upside-Downsizing!</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s make Scratch grow or shrink when we press the arrow keys!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/week2/img3.png" alt="image #3" /></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- One more time, set up the program so that it starts when we click the flag and runs forever.

- Now, create two conditionals: one that runs if the up arrow, and one that runs if the down arrow is pressed.

- Finally, complete the conditionals to make Scratch grow or shrink!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hereâ€™s one more block bank, but beware! You might need to use some of these twice!</p>
