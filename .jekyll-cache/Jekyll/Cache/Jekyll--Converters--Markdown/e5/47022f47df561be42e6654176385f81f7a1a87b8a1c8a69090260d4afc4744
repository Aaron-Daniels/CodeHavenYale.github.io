<h2 id="challenge-worksheet">Challenge Worksheet</h2>
<h3 id="make-a-start-page">Make a start page!</h3>

<p>We want to welcome people to our maze, so let’s make a start screen!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- First, choose a new backdrop for your maze by pressing the button in the bottom right corner.

- Then, play around with these blocks to make a start page!
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="make-a-you-win-page">Make a “you win” page!</h3>

<p>Let’s reward our players for beating the maze with a “you win” screen. It’s very similar to making a start page, so use the blocks above!</p>

<h3 id="add-a-points-system">Add a points system!</h3>

<p>When players get to the end or touch an object, they should get a point!</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> - First, make your own variable by pressing the make a variable button under the variables tab.

- Then, think about when you want your cat to earn points! For example, you could earn points when you win, when you touch a certain object, or when you press a certain keyboard key. 

- Set up a conditional that will check if this has happened, and then increases the points variable!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here are some blocks to start with:</p>

<h3 id="add-more-levels">Add more levels!</h3>

<p>This is a tricky one! Here are some questions to think about:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- When should my cat play a new level? 
- Should the rules be different in the new level? 
- How is the code similar in the new level? 

- Consider making a new background and using these blocks to get started: 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="add-sounds">Add sounds!</h3>

<p>Cats love to meow! Let’s make our Scratch cat speak out loud as he plays the game. Here are some blocks to start with:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/week7/bb4.png" alt="bb #4" /></p>

<h3 id="make-your-cat-teleport">Make your cat teleport!</h3>

<p>Add some teleportation portals to your maze! When the cat reaches a teleportation portal, it should change locations.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- How should you change the maze background so that teleportation makes sense? 

- Make sure you figure out the coordinates correctly!

- Here are some blocks to get started with:
